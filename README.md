Online Quiz Maker :
I developed a comprehensive website called "Online Quiz Maker," designed to streamline the creation and management of multiple-choice quizzes. The homepage features a robust authentication system:
new users can easily register, while returning users can log in seamlessly.

Upon successful login, users are redirected to the main dashboard. This dashboard includes a logout button for convenience and three primary functions:

1.Create MCQ: This feature allows users to craft multiple-choice questions with ease. Users can input questions, provide several answer options, and specify the correct answer.
  The questions are then stored in the system for future use.

2.View Library: This section provides a comprehensive overview of all the questions created. It displays each question along with its multiple-choice options, with the correct answers prominently 
  highlighted in bold green for easy identification.

3.Start a Quiz: This function enables users to take a quiz based on the questions stored in the library. After answering the questions, users can submit their responses. The system then cross-references
  their answers with the correct ones stored in the database and displays the results, including their score, on the screen.

The "Online Quiz Maker" is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, ensuring a smooth experience for both quiz creators and participants.
